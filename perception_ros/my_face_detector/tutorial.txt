The first thing to note is that this is not your run-of-the-mill RViz marker. This is because it's using the "jsk_rviz_plugins" package. 
You will have to install this package if you want to use it outside the Ignite Academy or RDS environments. 
These markers give a lot of functionality to RViz, and you could spend a whole course learning all the places where this can be applied. 
You can have a look at the ROS RViz Advanced Markers course to learn more about RViz markers.
The LaserScan and the PointCloud2 data are disconnected to avoid overflooding the PC because PCL consumes quite a lot of resources. 
But you can activate them by simply checking the box.
PeoplePositionMeasurementsArray: This is the blue circle drawn around the position of the face detected. It's the primary data we are looking for.
Camera: Just the RGB camera, as a reference, where RViz superimposes the PeoplePositionMeasurementsArray data.
